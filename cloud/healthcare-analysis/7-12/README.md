### Filtering results

In the previous section, (6-12) we saw that the manufacturer `TAKEDA`
that the drug `CUVITRA` has the highest number of reported reactions.

We can filter then results using a filter on `MATCH` or by using `WHERE` clause.

For example, find the number of reactions registered by the manufacturer `TAKEDA`
// look the the `filter-on-match.cypher` file...
